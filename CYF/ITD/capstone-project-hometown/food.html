        <h3>Farinata Savonese: A Taste of Coastal History</h3>
        <p>
          Golden, thin and slightly crispy on the edges, farinata is a beloved
          specialty of Savona, combining simple ingredients—chickpea flour,
          water and olive oil—to create a savory delight with a creamy center.
          Traditionally baked in large copper pans over a wood fire, it’s
          delicious on its own or topped with local favorites like sausage,
          pesto, cheese or fresh arugula. Each addition enhances farinata’s
          earthy flavors, making it a versatile treat perfect for every taste.
          Whether you enjoy it as street food or a shared dish at the table,
          farinata captures the warmth and culinary heart of Savona.

        <h3>Panissa: Savona’s Savory Chickpea Delight</h3>
        <p>
          Panissa is a humble yet delicious street food staple in Savona,
          crafted from chickpea flour, water and a hint of salt. Similar to
          farinata, panissa is cooked until firm, then sliced into thick pieces
          and either pan-fried to a golden crisp or served cold. With a mild,
          nutty flavor and a creamy interior, it’s a versatile dish that’s
          perfect on its own or enjoyed with a sprinkle of sea salt and a
          drizzle of olive oil. Often paired with local wines or served
          alongside olives and cheeses, panissa is a true taste of Savona’s
          culinary heritage—simple, savory and utterly satisfying.
