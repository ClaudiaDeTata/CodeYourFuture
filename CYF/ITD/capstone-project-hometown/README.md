# Hometown Homepage - Savona, Liguria (IT)

This website is the final capstone project of the Intro to Digital from the "Code Your Future" Software Development bootcamp.
The goal of this project is to develop a solo project, applying the knowledge gained in this first part of the course.
The website is about Savona, my adopted hometown. In fact, I was not born there, but I moved to Savona at the age of 4. Having spent most of my life there, I know the city like the back of my hand.
This project showcases a static collection of pages that demonstrate responsive design principles, all while providing an accessible and user-friendly interface.
